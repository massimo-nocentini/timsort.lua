# timsortlua

This repository contains a `timsort` Lua module that provides a `sort` function as an auxiliary sorting algorithm based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort.

The implementation is totally based and strictly follows the Python one, namely https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/b4f5f07d076d7e7d825306981108dbb7120d7377/Objects/listobject.c#L2251.
